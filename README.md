# Emergency-control-network

This project demonstrates a simulated network topology featuring:

- RIP Routing Protocol for dynamic route management.
- VLANs to segment the network for efficiency and security.
- Assigned Gateways to enable inter-VLAN and inter-network communication.

**Key Components**
- Routing Protocol: RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Switching: VLANs for isolating and managing traffic
- Firewall: Firewall on routers for security
- IP Addressing: Gateways assigned to each VLAN
- Centralized Control: For managing and monitoring network operations
