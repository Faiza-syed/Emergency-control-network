# Emergency-control-network
This project represents a network topology designed for efficient communication using RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic routing, VLANs for network segmentation, and assigned gateways for inter-network communication. The topology includes multiple subnets with distinct VLANs, switches, routers, and a centralized control center.
